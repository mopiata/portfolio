Title of Project
Margaret Mutungi Portfolio

Description
This is a site that gives the landing page to my portfolio of work since I joined coding school.

Getting started
This is a one page portfolio. It includes different sections i.e. About Me, Projects and Contacts. You can navigate to the different sections by scrolling or using the menu items at the top of the page. Each section gives relevant information about me. One link (Blog) is inactive and I hope to bring it up soon where I can share about different areas of interest for me.

Here is a link to the site: https://mopiata.github.io/portfolio/#about
