          <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
          <p>I am an upcoming developper growing in web application development. Currently the focus is on front end development. I have knack for fixing things and creating new ones. I am creative, kind and maybe funny.</p>
          <p>I decided to take a class in programming, first because I realized how well I acquire practical skills and programming had been one of those that I really wanted to grow. This, coupled with the fact that I found a great learning partner, made me have no doubt in my choice to be a programmer.</p>
          <p>In my spare time I like doing a bunch of other things. Walking, cooking(exploratory), teaching, singing, road tripping and finding out new stuff. I am a member of two choirs and I sing Soprano. One of the choirs is the African Youth Choir for which I will be part until 2020.</p>
