      <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an upcoming developper growing in web application development. Currently the focus is on front end development. I have knack for fixing things and creating new ones. I am creative, kind and maybe funny.</p>
      <p>I decided to take a class in programming, first because I realized how well I acquire practical skills and programming had been one of those that I really wanted to grow. This, coupled with the fact that I found a great learning partner, made me have no doubt in my choice to be a programmer.</p>
      <h3>School...</h3>

          <p>I am currently pursuing a web and mobile application development track that will see me learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Java, Angular and Android. It is a bootcamp environment that will also have me develop skills in other languages. It is a highly practical program and at the end I will be expected to churn high quality products which I will continue to update on this portfolio.</p>
